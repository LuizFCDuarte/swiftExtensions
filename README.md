# swiftExtensions
This repository contains some Swift 4 extensions which I found really useful


# This respository contains the following extensions:
  - String : contains a function that splits a String
  - Date : contains some date formatters that are useful when you are working in the brazilian date format
  - UIColor : contains a method that recognizes the color its "hex"
  - UIView : creates a gradient layer in the selected view
  - UIImage : decodes and encodes a UIImage in the base64 format
